# NASB Voice Mod

This mod allows you to add custom voice lines to all characters!

## Installation

The easiest way to install this is to use the [Slime Mod Manager](https://github.com/legoandmars/slimemodmanager/releases/latest).

-----

#### Manual Installation
*If your game isn't modded with BepinEx, DO THAT FIRST!*
Simply go to the [latest BepinEx release](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) and extract `BepinEx_x64_VERSION.zip` directly into your game's folder, then run the game once to install BepinEx properly.

This mod also requires Newtonsoft.JSON. You can download a copy of that [here](https://github.com/legoandmars/Newtonsoft.Json/releases/tag/12.0.3). Simply extract to the game's root folder.

Then, go to the [latest release of this mod](https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/NickVoiceMod/releases/latest) and extract the zip in your game's root folder.

## Usage

Place voicepacks in `BepInEx/Voicepacks` (run the game with the mod installed if you don't see this folder).

**Voicepacks must be in .VOICEPACK (preferred) or .ZIP (legacy) format!** Use the [Voicepack Packer](https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/NickVoicepackPacker) to create your own custom voicepacks.

Only use one per character, additional voicepacks will be ignored!
